♻️ Intelligent Waste Segregation Using Deep Learning

This project classifies waste images into **organic** and **reusable** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
It includes a training notebook and a real-time prediction web app built with **Streamlit**.


🚀 Features

- Deep learning model (CNN) to classify waste into organic and reusable
- Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
- Accuracy graph and confusion matrix
- Google Drive hosted trained model
- Sample predictions and interface screenshots


🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
